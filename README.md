# co2mon.nz Ventilation Monitor

Inspired by https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor

## Description

This is a prototype CO2 based ventilation monitor intended for fixed
(wall-mounted) use in standard residential, office and retail type spaces. It
uses the well regards Sensirion SCD40 CO2 sensor as well as a Bosch BME680 for
VOC and barometric pressure measurement and a Sensirion SHT30 for temperature
and humidity.

WiFi connectivity is provided by the main ESP32-S3 processor allowing
measurements to be reported back to the https://co2mon.nz/ web service if
desired.
